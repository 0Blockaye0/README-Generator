  # Professional README Generator

  ## Description 

  This project is aimed at making the creation of a readme.md file as easy and efficient as possible.  Just answer the questions that the inquirer asks, and your file will be generated with headings, links, table of contents, screenshots, contact info, and other details the user may need. The more detail you provide the better! Your professional readme will be in the ‘Develop/dist’ folder when completed.

  ## Installation

  From the root directory of the repository, open the CLI and and run the command ‘npm install inquirer’. Also, don’t forget to add an ‘assets’ folder to the root directory. Inside the ‘assets’ folder, create another folder named ‘images’. Add a screen shot to this folder so that it can be used in your generated readme file.


  ## Usage

  Make sure you have node installed. Then, from the root directory, open the CLI and run the command ‘node app’ and answer the questions to the best of your ability.  Use the readme generator for every project so your users can have all the information they need to use your app and contact the creators and contributors.
